# IITC plugin: Uniques merger (sync)

Allows to merge (sync) data across devices and even accounts. For now handles merging uniques (captures and visits).

Unlike sync plugin it is built to last and is not depended on any external service. You don't have to worry to synchronize your data immediately. Merge can be done at any point and all conflicts will be resolved properly so that you won't miss any of your captures.

Assuming you already have IITC just &rarr; **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-data-merger/raw/master/data-merger.user.js)**.

Note. When you open the user script URL the installation dialog should be shown by Tampermonkey. If it doesn't show then just try to refresh the page or re-visit the URL again.
