# IITC plugin: Uniques merger (sync)

Allows to merge (sync) data across devices and even accounts. For now handles merging uniques (captures and visits).

Unlike sync plugin it is built to last and is not depended on any external service. You don't have to worry to synchronize your data immediately. Merge can be done at any point and all conflicts will be resolved properly so that you won't miss any of your captures.
